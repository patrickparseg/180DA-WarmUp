Task 4
1. Thresholding HSV was better and more accurate. I did a threshold range
that was only for the specific color I wanted to track so the range was not
too big.

2. With the lighting condition change, I needed to adjust the threshold values
to make sure the color was still recognized within the range.

3. Changing the phone brightness did not change anything and the code was
able to track the color regardless.

4. The phone is more robust to brightness.
